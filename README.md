Description: Balloting is an age old method for realizing consensus among participants with different opinions and opposing views. An online digital balloting opens up its application to diverse applications from a local land dispute resolution to planetary level decision on global governance. You are required to design and develop a Dapp that can enable a trustworthy and transparent online voting system with automatic counting of votes. To address these needs, you will design and implement an Ethereum blockchain-based Dapp.

Our Use Case: NBA MVP Award selection voting

Voters: Voters are Sportwriters and Broadcasters from USA/Canada. Each member of the voting panel casts a vote for first to           fifth place selections.

        1st place -> 10 points
        2nd place -> 7 points
        3rd place -> 5 points
        4th place -> 3 points
        5th place -> 1 points
        
        Candidate with highest point wins the NBA MVP Award.
